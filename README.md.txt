# 🪶 Feather Fall

Feather Fall is a machine learning project with a Streamlit web app interface that analyses and predicts bird data insights.

---

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main components:

### 1. Streamlit App (Frontend)
- The main `app.py` file serves as the **frontend of the project**.
- Handles **user interactions**, including input forms, buttons, and displaying outputs such as charts, tables, and predictions.
- Connects with **backend models and data** to generate real-time results.

### 2. Data Folder
- Contains **datasets required for the project**.
- Used by the backend models for **analysis and prediction**.

### 3. Models Folder
- Contains **trained machine learning models** used by the app.
- Models are loaded dynamically to generate predictions based on user input.
